# dot

My (highly opinionated) dotfiles and collection of various shell scripts.

### tl;dr

Made for Arch LinuxÂ®

Minimalistic, modular.

Shell - fish

WM - [qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) with window management handled by [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)

Text editor - [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and 100+ plugins

Music - [MPD](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD)

Integrations with RescueTime, Wunderlist

### Philosophy

- Split things into multiple files whenever possible
- Minimalism
- UNIX-y, every tool does its own thing well
- No unnecessary fluff or visual effects
- Focus on maximising productivity
- Keep the home directory as clean as possible (XDG-compliance)
